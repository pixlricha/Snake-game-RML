This project focuses on developing a reinforcement learning model to play the classic Snake game using Python, PyTorch, and Pygame. The aim is to create an AI agent that can learn and improve its performance in the game through trial and error, leveraging deep Q-learning techniques. The project will explore the fundamentals of reinforcement learning, neural network design, and game development, providing a comprehensive understanding of AI in gaming.
